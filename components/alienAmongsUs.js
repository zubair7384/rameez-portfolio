            Louis Vuitton's Intergalactic Handbag Collection is an AI-generated
            concept campaign for Louis Vuitton's latest handbag collection
            including Louis Vuitton Alma, Louis Vuitton Speedy, and Louis
            Vuitton Never Fall.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this campaign aliens from other worlds are featured as models for
            these exclusive handbags. All the concept images are generated using
            the popular text to image AI Midjourney.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core campaign idea is to show that you too can be stylishly
            distinctive. Taking this concept further to a fashion show, models
            can don ultra-realistic Alien masks/hoods and carry the latest Louis
            Vuitton handbags with pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            This campaign is all about luxury and exclusivity â€“ two things that
            Louis Vuitton is known for.
